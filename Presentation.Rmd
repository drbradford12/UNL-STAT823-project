##Part 1: Data Management
As an applied statistican, I believe that it is important ti talk about the process it takes to get the "right dataset"  
    - Meta-Analysis of data pulled from sources 
        - Kaggle 
        - ESPN 
        - pro-football-reference.com  
    
•	present a topic related (at least loosely) to Stat 823 subject matter
•	explain why it is of interest & who would find the topic of interest
•	if it is a method, who would use it, when and why?
•	give an example of its application


## Slide with R Output

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
